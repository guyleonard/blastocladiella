blastocladiella
===============

This is a repository of all the scripts and output I have generated from sequencing the genome of Blastocladiella emersonii.


Eventually I will upload post-assembly files, to include:

Potentially
* Gene Predictions
* Protein/Amino Acids
* EST Filtering
* CEGMA Analyses
* GFF3 Data
* Annotation Data
* OrthoMCL Analysis
* BLAST2GO Data

Unlikely
* Sequence Reads
* Assembly Data

Anything else will be available on completion of the genome paper.
